      Push Notifications
  </h2>
  Everything you'd expect from Push Notifications
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="https://chatness.app/images/tour/push-notifications-1x1.gif">
  <br>
  <h3 >First time senders</h3>
  When a contact that has never talked to you before send a private message, that very first message will fire a notification on your registered devices (iphone, android, ipad, tablet, etc). Devices are registered on every login and deregistered on logout.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="https://chatness.app/images/tour/push-notifications-first-time-sender.jpeg">
  <br>
  <h3>1x1 push</h3>
  Once you estabilish contact with someone, your registered devices should receive all notifications from that person in background (app closed or minimized) and increase the app badge counter. Badge counter is reseted once you open the app.
  <br>  <br>
  <img src="https://chatness.app/images/tour/push-notifications-1x1.gif">
  <br>
  <h3 >Groups push</h3>
  When a chat group is visited you automatically opt-in to receive notifications from all the users inside that group.
  <br>  <br>
  <img src="https://chatness.app/images/tour/push-notifications-group.jpeg">
  <br>
  <h3>Notification Settings</h3>
  You can always decide later on from whom you want to receive push notifications, both for groups and users.
  <br>  <br>
  <img src="https://chatness.app/images/tour/push-notifications-settings.jpeg">
  <br>
  <h3>Chat Settings</h3>
  You can also silent an user or group directly from the chat using the menu option (three dots) in the top/right corner.

   Frequently asked questions
</h2>
<h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl mt-2">
   How do I purchase a license for my entire team?
</h2>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">
   You can purchase a license that you can share with your entire team
   for $499 USD.<br /><br />Team licenses are still just a single user
   account (at least for now)
   <br /><br />For more information on team
   licensing specifics, <a href="https://chatness.app/license">read through our license</a>.
</p>
<h2 >
   What does "unlimited projects" mean?
</h2>
<p >
   Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new
   Chatness license every time you want to use it on a new project.<br /><br />As
   long as what you're building will be owned by the Chatness license
   holder, you can build as many sites as you want without ever having to
   buy an additional license.<br /><br />For more information and
   examples, <a href="https://chatness.app/license">read through our license</a>
</p>
<h2>
   What does "free updates" include?
</h2>
<p >
   We're planning to add new features and components regularly over time
   and all new components added will be totally free for existing
   customers. We may work on new features/component "kits" in the future
   that would be sold separately (eg: admin systems, dashboards, backend
   jobs, etc) but any components we design and build that belong into an
   existing kit will always be added as a free update for everyone who
   has bought that kit.
</p>
<h2 >
   What JS framework does Chatness use?
</h2>
<p>
   In order to be as universal as possible, Chatness is built on top of
   Angular and Ionic. But it also exports web components to serve as an
   HTML-only component library making it easy to integrate on every
   existing framework, or even in pure javascript. You can check
   <a href="https://github.com/chatness/examples"
      >implementation examples in here</a
      >. To get a better idea of how this would work in an angular scenario,
   please
   <a href="https://chatness.app/setup/install">check out our documentation.</a>
</p>
<h2>
   Can I sell templates/themes I build with Chatness?
</h2>
<p>
   No, you cannot use Chatness to create derivative products like themes,
   UI kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be
   repackaging and redistributing our components for someone else to use
   to build their own apps. For more information and examples of what is
   and isn't okay, <a href="https://chatness.app/license">read through our license</a>.
</p>
<h2">
Can I use Chatness for my own commercial projects?
</h2>
<p>
   Absolutely yes! Your license gives you permission to build as many of
   your own projects as you like, whether those are simple public
   websites, SaaS or app applications that end users need to pay to
   access. <br />For more information and examples,
   <a href="https://chatness.app/license">read through our license</a>.
</p>
<h2 >
   Can I use Chatness in open source projects?
</h2>
<p >
   No! You're not allowed to build or redistribute any piece of Chatness
   as open-source.<br />For more information and examples of what is and
   isn't okay, <a href="https://chatness.app/license">read through our license</a>
</p>
<h2>
   What browsers does Chatness support?
</h2>
<p >
   The components in Chatness are designed to work in the latest, stable
   releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and
   Edge. We don't support Internet Explorer 11.
</p>
<h2>What is your refund policy?</h2>
<p>
   If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at
   support@chatness.app within 7 days and we'll refund you in full, no
   questions asked.
