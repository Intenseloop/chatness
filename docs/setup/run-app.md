# Run the App

### Development mode

To run the app in development mode with hot module replacement (HMR) activated

```sh
npm run start
```

This command will start the app on port 8100 and host 0.0.0.0 so you can easily access from other devices on your wifi network

### Production mode

```sh
npm run start:prod
```

Same as above but with production bundle and no HMR
